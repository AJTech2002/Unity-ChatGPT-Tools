# Unity-ChatGPT-Tools
A simple Chat GPT Integration for Unit that allows code to be generated through Chat GPT, send to Unity and run automatically.

# Instructions
1. Create a OpenAPI Account
2. Replace the secret key in `OpenAIStructures.cs` with the secret key you recieved
3. Open the Editor Window through *Window/Prompt Runner* you can either enter the prompt through the window or the text field in the scene view, hit enter and something should happen
